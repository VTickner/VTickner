# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there
I'm a tech career changer actively seeking a career change into software development. I'm currently carrying out self-study via online resources such as Udemy, [Code First Girls](https://codefirstgirls.com/) and [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), to improve my knowledge of software development tools and languages.
